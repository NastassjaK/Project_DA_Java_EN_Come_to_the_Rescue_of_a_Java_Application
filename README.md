# Debug a Java application

The following Java application is a trend analysis program able to describes a symptom and its number of occurrences.

## How it works 
Reads the file "Symptom.txt" and deduces the number of occurrences of the same disease. 
If the disease appears for the first time, the program adds it to the map.
The program will create the result.out file, which will display the diseases and their number of occurrences. 

## Usage 
Add a disease / a new disease type into the Symptom.txt file and launch the program.
